# 🌍 LeetHack Level 2: Green Transit – Code for a Cleaner Commute

Welcome to **LeetHack**, the gamified coding challenge designed to help you build real-world skills as a computer scientist. In this level, your team is working on **Green Transit**, a prototype app to encourage eco-friendly travel in urban areas.

Your mission is to **design, build, and test a system that helps users reduce their carbon footprint** by tracking journeys, displaying sustainable habits, and delivering an accessible user experience.

You are part of a 4-person software team. Each of you has a **specific role** and must complete a task suited to your skill level: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced**.

---

## 🧭 Project Goal

Develop components of a green transport app. Each task simulates a real CS role. You'll work independently, but your team's success depends on each role completing their part.

---

## 👥 Roles and Tasks

### 🧑‍💻 Software Engineer

- **Beginner**: Implement a method that calculates CO₂ savings when walking/cycling instead of driving a set distance.
- **Intermediate**: Write a script that logs user trips in a CSV or JSON file and updates total emissions saved.
- **Advanced**: Create `Trip` and `User` classes in an OOP structure. Simulate a week's worth of green trips with random distances and generate a summary.

---

### 🔐 Cybersecurity Specialist

- **Beginner**: Build a simple password encoder using a shift cipher (e.g. Caesar cipher).
- **Intermediate**: Validate passwords: check for minimum length, numbers, and special characters.
- **Advanced**: Develop a login system that stores and verifies hashed passwords using SHA-256. Reject incorrect or reused passwords.

---

### 📊 Data Analyst

- **Beginner**: Load a provided `trips.csv` file and compute total emissions saved by all users.
- **Intermediate**: Plot user emissions over time using `matplotlib`. Save your chart as an image.
- **Advanced**: Write a script that manually groups users by travel habits (e.g. frequent walker vs. occasional cyclist) and recommends strategies based on their category.

---

### 🎨 UX Designer

- **Beginner**: Sketch a home screen for the Green Transit app. Show 3 features that encourage green travel.
- **Intermediate**: Code a static HTML page with accessible fonts, colours, and proper labels.
- **Advanced**: Create a responsive multi-section homepage using HTML/CSS only. Highlight design choices that meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (e.g., contrast ratio, dyslexia-friendly text).
